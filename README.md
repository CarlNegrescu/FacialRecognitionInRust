## About The Project

FaceFrame RS is a project created to learn the Rust programming language by building a practical, high-performance application. The goal is to create a complete facial recognition system, from capturing a video feed to identifying known individuals.

The project is structured as a Cargo workspace to promote modular and clean code.

### Current Status

‚úÖ **Working!** The application can successfully:
* Connect to a system webcam.
* Capture live video frames.
* Display the video feed in a desktop window at ~60 FPS.

The core facial detection and recognition logic has not yet been implemented.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Rust Toolchain**: Make sure you have Rust installed. You can get it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
* **A Webcam**: The application requires a connected camera.

### Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your_repository_name
    ```
3.  **Run the main application:**
    Since this is a Cargo workspace, you need to specify which package to run.
    ```sh
    cargo run --package main_app
    ```
4.  A window showing your camera feed should appear. Press the **ESC** key to close it.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This project is a Cargo workspace containing multiple crates:

* `camera_capture/`: A library crate responsible for abstracting all camera interactions. It provides a simple API for the main application to use.
* `facial_detection_library/`: (Placeholder) This crate will contain the logic for detecting faces in an image.
* `main_app/`: The main binary crate that ties everything together. It handles the windowing, event loop, and displays the final output.

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

* [ ] Integrate a facial **detection** model to find faces in the video stream.
* [ ] Implement a facial **embedding** model to create unique identifiers for detected faces.
* [ ] Add a simple database or file system to store and manage known faces.
* [ ] Draw bounding boxes and names over faces in the live video feed.
